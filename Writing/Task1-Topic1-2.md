Dear Mary

I have heard that you are considering quitting your job at this company in order to attend university. I have been impressed with your ideas and with how hard you work. In my view you are an excellent employee, and it is my hope that you will reconsider your plan.

I see several issues with quitting your job. As you know, the economy is not doing well at the moment and few companies are hiring new workers. I have read many reports that say this situation will probably continue for a number of years. When you look for work again after going back to university, I am worried that you may find it hard to get a job.

Although many employers want to hire those who have a university education, they are often more interested in employing people with relevant work experience. As a result, continuing to work in this job will give you valuable work skills. With improved skills you may get a promotion at this company, or you may find a great position at another company. For these two reasons, I strongly advise you to continue working.

Please come to my office anytime if you with to discuss this further.

Robert Smith

##My Answer:

To whom it may concern:

I live at 123 New Town Street in Ottawa, Ontario. My apartment is just across the street from your Good Night nightclub, which was opened a month ago, if I remember correctly.

I'm writing to complain about the loud noise caused by your nightclub. Since it's opened, every night approximately after 8 PM, the loud music starts to play, together with the customers' loud talk when they arrive at the club, until very late at night when customers leave. This has a big impact on my life, I AM hardly able to sleep early, and I AM hardly able to concentrate on doing anything because of the disturbing noise your night club made.

I sincerely would like you to take some actions, such as put on sign at the entrance of your nightclub, letting your customers keep quite when they are outside, also put down the volume of the music as much as possible. I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who suffers from the noise, and people who lives on the same street would be happier if you can apply my suggestions.

Thank you

Mr R Smith

## Example

Dear NightClub Owner:

I live at 123 New Street in NewTown, Ontario. My home is just across the street from the GoodNight nightclub that you own at 128 New Street.

I am writing to complain about the noise from the club. Since the club opened last month, I have been disturbed by the noise from the club and
from your customers. The music, which starts at 7 PM and ends after 3 Am is very loud, and people going to the club laugh and shout as they 
arrive and leave, and this has big impact on my live. The noise makes it impossible for me or my family to sleep properly.

I would like you to play music at your club more quitely and to add some kind of barrier to block the noise. I would also like you to ask
your customers to think about people when they arrive and leave. This would not be perfect for me,  as I am sure that I would still hear some
noise, but it would definitely improve the situation. I am sure that other people living on my street would feel happier if you adopted these ideas.

Thank you

Mr R Smith

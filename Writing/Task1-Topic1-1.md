I live at 123 New Street in Newtown, Manitoba. My home is just across
the street from the entrance of North Lake Park.

I am writing to complain about noise in the park. Since last month, some students from Newtown College have been hanging out in the park from approximately 8PM to(until) late at night. They do this most days, but especially on weekends. The students talk and play music loudly, and something they even play soccer or other sports and games. This has big impact on my life because the noise makes it hard for me and my family to sleep.

I would like you to put up signs in North Lake Park asking people to be quite if they use the park in the evening or at night. Alternatively, I would like you to lick the park after 8 PM so that nobody can hang out there after dark and disturbs others by being noisy. I am sure that other people living on my street would feel happier if you adopted one of these suggestions.

Thank you.
Mr R Smith

## 考什么：

## Phrase:
- the man might…
- the cat would probably…
- the blond woman may …

## Example:
1：the little girl may possibly catch her cat as the boy wearing the red shirt will help her catch it. 
Her mother would probably be very happy for her daughter

2: I will predict some of the people in the classroom seem might do next, and some of the things might happen next.
I think the two teachers who are talking together in the door way will finish their conversation, and the female teather
will turn around. I imagine that the two children working on the blackboard will answer the question and return to   their desks. The 
five students who are reading books at their desks will continue studying or stop reading and listen to the teacher.
The girl making a funny face, the girl passing a note, the boy throwing a paper airplane, the boy eating a sandwich and 
the two boys playing a video game will probably all pay attention, because the teacher will see what they are doing and 
ask them to stop their bad behaviour.

Obviously I can't been sure that any of the predictions will come true, but perhaps some of them will.

## 一定要包括：
- 预测
- 理由


## 注意时态： 将来时 + modals expressing predictions

## 网摘经验:
- 可以预测动作，心情变化，物理变化

- 推测不需要合理，想到什么说什么就行。你描述你将要提到的人的时候必定还会提到他们之前在做什么，仍然是让人很心累的题目。 

- 推测时描述的不一定非要是task3 描述过的，但task3 描述过，意味着你可以直接拿过来用，修饰某个人或事物

## Example:
This sceen shows what looks like in a elementary class room, I will describe some of the  things and people I can
see in the pictute and say what they are doing. At the front of the room, a man and a woman who seem to
be teachers are talking together in the door way. The female teacher has her back to us. Near to
them are two students who are working together to solve a question on the blackboard. The rest of the room is
filled with students sitting at their desks. Five of the students are reading books, among the others,
one girl is making a funny face and another girl is passing a note to her friend. One boy is about to 
throw a paper airplane, another boy is eating a sandwich, and two others boys are playing a video game.

There are more I could describe, but I hope this gives a clear overall impression of the sceen.

## 注意时态： 现在进行时
	
## 网摘经验
首先你就不可能把所有人都说清（60s之内），然后每次你描述一个人都需要尽可能的提供细节，配上精确的用词，包括这个人所在图里的方位。]

不一定非要一句话把一个人说清楚，可以这样：In the middle of the picture I can see two women taking a selfie. One of them seems to be gregnant.

首先我们要积累一些表达形状，颜色，动作，表情的词，这些都是描述场景和人物的基础。然后要注意说的顺序和逻辑

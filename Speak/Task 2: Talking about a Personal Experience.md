## 考什么：
your ability to tell past stories

## Phrase:

## Example:
In my life, I often have great times with friends and family members. If I have to pick up one thing 
to talk about, however, it will be visiting New York city with my brother.

 It happened a number of years
ago when I was 21 and my brother was 24.  He won an competition, and the prize was a free trip to 
New York for 2 people for one week. My borther invited me and we had a great time. We visited central 
park, and other tourist places. Had some wonderful meals at great restaurants,  and went to see a base
ball game. We also visited some fantastic museums, and did some shopping. 

All in all, it was a great trip. Since that time, I have visited New York again, but the trip with my
brother was definitely the best.

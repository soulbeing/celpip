## Phrase:


## Example:
The house you chose definitely has some good points. However, there are a couple of reasons why I think my choice, 
the downtown townhouse is the better option for our new home. For one thing, although the townhouse costs more than
 the country home, it is better value. The reason is it is only 20 persent expensive, but over 80 persent larger, as you
 know we need a fairly large house. So I think the size of the townhouse makes it a good choice. For other thing, none of
 us like driving, the county home looks pieceful, but we have to drive anytime we want to go somewhere, see somebody, or
 buy something. In contrast, the townhouse is convinient for public transportation, so we could do anything we want without
 having to drive.
 
 I hope you understand and agree with my reasons, the thinking of my option is a better choice for our family.

## 一定要包括：
- three factors you are going to use supporting your product（不一定要全说）

## 网摘经验
- 答题点包括对比和说服，所以一定需要两幅图信息都提到，形成对比。然后既然是说服，当然还是要提供理由(理由都是编的！！！见风使舵)，配合说服的口吻

- 不要直白的对比，不是让你比大小，要比的更加煞费苦心elaborate一点，比如价格一个100 一个200，
就要说one is cheaper than the other, 而不要说one is 100， the other is 200

- Remember also to keep a convincing tone, yet polite at the same time.

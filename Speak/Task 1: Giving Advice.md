- 杜绝命令的词汇，哪怕是非常强烈的建议，如
	- must　　->   really should
	
## 使用时态： 一般时

## Easy to apply reasons

## 网摘经验

第一题是给一个朋友某个建议。特别之处是你要以和朋友聊天的口吻进行叙述，刚开始上来要打招呼，不要命令别人去做什么事，要商量着给建议，最后最好再来个祝福。算是有Intro+outro吧。第一题和第七题是90s作答，其他都是60s。我这次第一题遇到的是一个朋友的妈妈要过生日了，给他一个建议，送什么礼物好


## Example:
 Hi David, I understand you are looking for a summer job, I find work every summer, so perhaps I can give you some helpful advice.
 
 First, I recommend you begin your job serch online, there are a couple of reasons why I say this: first it doesn't cost you
 any money to search most job sites and second you can do it whenever you want. You can even go out to a coffee shop to do it, if you like.
 In the past I found several jobs by searching online, so perhaps you will have similar success.
 	
Second, in addition to search jobs online, why don't you visit some stores or businesses where you think you might like to work.
You can ask to speak to a manager and explain to him or her that you are looking for a summer job. In my experience, managers
are often impressed by people who look for work in person. In fact, that's how I get my job las year.

Anyway, good luck with your job search. I'm sure you will find a great position soon
